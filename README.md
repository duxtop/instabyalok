An Example app to fill the portfolio during job-hunt

# Following principles are being preferred in a code:

-   Component name starts with Capital letter.
-   Every component has its own folder with style and test files
-   Reused components should be moved to UI folder in the root
-   Every Variable or function name should explain what do they mean or do. This makes no difference to the end user, but means a lot to the team

# Used Tech Stack:

-   React - because React is reactive
-   Typescript - Typescript is Javascript on Steroids
-   React Bootstrap - Saves tonns of time, already has style structre, and is possible to migrate to another design system, like AntDesign for example
-   React Icons - includes all icons from different design systems
-   Jest - code without tests? are you serious?
